## Overview

Garbage classification is an important step in effective waste management and recycling. This project uses image data to classify garbage into various categories, helping to automate the segregation process.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANAGHAKTP/Garbage-Classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Garbage-Classification
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If requirements.txt is not present, install common packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras, etc.)

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions inside to run the classification tasks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of different types of garbage. (Add a link or description about the dataset if available.)

## Results

(Provide a summary of the model results, accuracy, and findings here. Add plots or images if necessary.)
